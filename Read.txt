5 Meter range us100 Y401 sonar (Aug 22 2023 update distance of sonar to 5 meters Note: sensitivity or acurracy may Vari )
2 trigger servo range


Inorder for this to work Bluetooth radio must be set to a on Communication serial on any device to baud  57600 
Radar_F and Radar_R are servo reverse option
